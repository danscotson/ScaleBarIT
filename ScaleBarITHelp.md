# ScaleBarIT guide

Written by Dan Scotson, 29/10/2024.

Welcome to the ScaleBarIT guide. ScaleBarIT enable users to add scale bars to images quickly and efficiently. The basic steps involve choosing your image, specifying its pixel size, then choosing a region of interest and finally adding your scale bar of choice.

Dan has built this capability during his PhD in a Materials Science field and hopes the distribution of this app will provide a tailored and simple solution to adding scale bars to images.

## Getting started:
Install with the ScaleBarIT_installer from the repository.

## Instructions on use:

There are four major steps that can be performed in ScaleBarIt.
1. Select Image
2. Select Pixel Size
3. Region of Interest Method
4. Add Scale Bar
5. Save Image

Guiding you through these steps in the app is a colour coding system - red = not possible yet, blue = possible and green = complete.

### 1. Select Image
Select an image file of your choice and visualise this in the app.

### 2. Select Pixel Size
Selecting the pixel size of your image is really important.

Selecting the pixel size can be performed by two methdods.
#### 1. Known (i.e. you know what the pixel size is).
- Enter the known pixel size in the pop up menu.
#### 2. From Image (i.e. there's an existing scale bar in the uploaded image that can be used).
- Choose a region of interest containing a scale bar. This involves cropping the image. First drag the interactive box into the desired position, then right click and select 'Crop image' to confirm.
- Then a new image will appear, click at each end of the horizontal extent of the existing scale bar. Press enter to confirm.
- Then confirm the size of the scale bar and the units in the pop up menu.

  
### 3. Region of Interest Method
You don't want all your image being displayed?

You have two options here:
#### 1. Point (i.e Centre the new image around a point in the existing image)
   - Click on a single point, then press enter.
#### 2. Crop (i.e. UI to select a region of interest)
- Any crop commands require the dragging of the interactive box, then right click and select 'Crop image' to confirm.

### 4. Add Scale Bar

Options are available for adding scale bars that are at least half of your image after the pixel size has been determined.

### 5. Save image:
You have two options to save the image.
#### 1. Press the Save Image button once it is blue or green.
   
   The image will be saved in a location of your choice with _proc_SB added to the filename.

#### 2. Press the Save Button that appears in the top right toolbar of the image.

## Key bits:
+ Any crop commands require the dragging of the interactive box, then right click and select 'Crop image' to confirm.
+ Grayed out labels are not enabled and need another step before becoming available.
+ Feedback to user gives tips as to what is next/what has happened.
+ Hover over buttons or functionality to get further help in the user interface.

## Menu settings:
### 1. Reset
  - Made an error or want to reload another image/start again.
### 2. Font
  - Change the font name, size and font weight (e.g. 'normal' and 'bold')
  - Change the font colour
### 3. Appearance
   - Change the style of the scale bar - solid rectangle or H shape. The thickness of the H can also be set here.
    - Height of the footer (i.e. chosen as a % of the entire image').
   - Change the colour of the scale bar (font colour can be updated in the font menu).
- Select position of the scale bar (e.g. bottom left or bottom right).
 ###  4. Edit Image
  - Rotate the image clockwise or anticlockwise by 90Â°.
  ### 5. Save settings
  - Change the resolution of the saved image.
 ### 6. Info
    - Copyright notice.
