# ScaleBarIT

Welcome to ScaleBarIT created by Dan Scotson.

## Why use ScaleBarIT?
ScaleBarIT enable users to add scale bars to images quickly and efficiently. The basic steps involve choosing your image, specifying its pixel size, then choosing a region of interest and finally adding your scale bar of choice.

Dan has built this capability during his PhD in a Materials Science field and hopes the distribution of this app will provide a tailored and simple solution to adding scale bars to images.

## How can I get started?
Download the installer from the repository. While the code has been written in MATLAB, the app is a standalone installation which does not require MATLAB software to use.

## How can I help?
Please feel free to add issues where necessary.
Suggestions of improvements and additional features are extremely welcome. Please feel to add issues or contact Dan directly via email at daniel.scotson@manchester.ac.uk.
