# ScaleBarIT

**Welcome to ScaleBarIT created by Dan Scotson**.

## Why use ScaleBarIT?
ScaleBarIT enables users to **add scale bars to images quickly and efficiently**. The basic steps involve choosing your image, specifying its pixel size, then choosing a region of interest and finally adding your scale bar of choice.

Dan has built this capability during his PhD in a Materials Science field and hopes the distribution of this app will provide a tailored and simple solution to adding scale bars to images.

## How can I get started?
**Download the installer from the repository**. While the code has been written in MATLAB, the app is a standalone installation which does not require MATLAB software to use.

## Publishing and acknowledgement
If you publish any of the images created using **ScaleBarIT**, please honour the licensing and cite this repository. You can get an APA or LaTeX formatted bibliographical reference using the 'Cite this repository' feature on the right-hand information menu.

## How can I help?
Please feel free to **add issues where necessary**.
Suggestions of improvements and additional features are extremely welcome. Please feel to add issues or contact **Dan directly via email at daniel.scotson@manchester.ac.uk**.
